//Implement a loop that will print the number 'a' until it is less than 10.
//For example, if the number is '1' the output should be:
//123456789
var a1 = Number(prompt("Take number")); //create a variable
while (a1 < 10) { //while the variable is less than 10
    console.log(a1); //print the variable
    a1++; //increment the variable
